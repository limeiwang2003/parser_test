[135] The starting point in relation to issues of privilege regarding mediation or without prejudice communication is in the Evidence Act 2006.

[142] The issue of the impact of the "entire agreement" clause in the deed of settlement is separate to issues arising under s 57 of the Evidence Act. Counsel for the defendant, Mr Grove, in his closing submissions referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in PAE (New Zealand) Ltd v Brosnahan8 and acknowledged that, in that case, Harrison J delivering the judgment for the Court, had observed that due to s 4(1) of the Contractual Remedies Act 1979, entire agreement clauses are neither absolute nor conclusive, and the courts have a wide discretion to refuse to uphold them where it is not "fair and reasonable that the provision should be conclusive".
