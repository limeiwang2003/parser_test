[459] Ms Xiao seeks relief on the basis that the Term Loan Agreement and the addenda to that agreement are consumer credit contracts under the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 ("the Act"),

[460] As Tipping J explained in Hansen v R:42

[2] Section 17 of the Insolvency Act 2006 (the Act) provides that a debtor commits an act of bankruptcy in certain circumstances. Further, and of relevance to the present case, section 16 of the Act says that a debtor must not be adjudicated bankrupt on a creditorâ€™s application unless the debtor has committed an act of bankruptcy within the period of 3 months before the creditor files the application.

[461] The Act has particular provisions that apply to consumer credit contracts, which are defined in s 11.
