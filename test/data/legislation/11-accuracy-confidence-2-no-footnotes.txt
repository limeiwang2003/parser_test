[2] Section 17 of the Insolvency Act 2006 provides that a debtor commits an act of bankruptcy in certain circumstances. Further, and of relevance to the present case, it must be shown that the debtor has not, within 10 working days of service of the notice, complied with it or satisfied the Court that he or she has a cross claim against the creditor. A cross claim means a counterclaim set-off or cross demand that is equal to or greater than the judgment debt or the amount that the debtor has been ordered to pay, and which the debtor could not use as a defence in the action or proceedings in which the judgment or the order was obtained.
