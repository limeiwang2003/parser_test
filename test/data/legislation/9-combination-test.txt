[4] Ms Xiao seeks relief on the basis that the Term Loan Agreement and the addenda to that agreement are consumer credit contracts under the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 (CCCFA), and that as the requisite disclosure was not provided, the loan agreements are unenforceable. Ms Xiao also seeks to have the loan agreements reopened under the CCCFA on the basis that they are oppressive and were entered into by oppressive means. Finally, Ms Xiao seeks a declaration that the various loan agreements are illegal contracts and unenforceable, being contracts for the provision of credit for gambling by a person conducting gambling, in contravention of s 15 of the Gambling Act 2003.

The Evidence Act 2006.

[5] In addition to Mr Haughey's opinion evidence, there is also the fact that SkyCity is required by s 308(1) and (4) of the Gambling Act to develop a policy for identifying problem gamblers and it must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the policy is used to identify actual or potential problem gamblers. It would commit an offence if it did not, as would its venue manager and its agents.16

[459] The loan agreements are indisputably credit contracts within the meaning of s 7(1) of the CCCFA. The CCCFA regulates all credit contracts. Ms Xiao submits that the loan agreements are consumer credit contracts. Section 13 provides:
In any proceedings in which a party claims that a credit contract is a consumer credit contract, it is presumed that the credit contract is a consumer credit contract unless the contrary is established.

[460] As Tipping J explained in Hansen v R:42
[95] ... The composite expression "until the contrary is proved" has a clear, simple and well understood legal meaning. It places a persuasive onus on the
42 Hansen v R [2007] NZSC 7, [2007] 3 NZLR 1.

accused, not just an evidential onus. The accused must establish to the satisfaction of the tribunal of fact the contrary of what is otherwise presumed against him. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities ...
[461] The CCCFA has particular provisions that apply to consumer credit contracts, which are defined in s 11.
