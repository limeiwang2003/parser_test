IN THE HIGH COURT OF NEW ZEALAND DUNEDIN REGISTRY

CIV-2011-412-000762 [2012] NZHC 507

IN THE MATTER OF

an appeal pursuant to s 106(2)(b) of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003

BETWEEN AND

RAVI VAS VOHORA Appellant
A PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT COMMITTEE Respondent

Hearing: 15 and 16 December 2011 Appearances: C S Withnall QC for Appellant
M McClelland and H Brown for Respondent Judgment: 23 March 2012
JUDGMENT OF WHATA J

[1] Over a period of some ten years Mr Vohora has objected to documenting standard operating procedures. He says that they are instruments of delegation. In his view pharmacists should not delegate key functions to staff and therefore standard operating procedures are not only unnecessary but are inappropriate. Mr Vohora was charged with professional misconduct within the scope of his practice, or in the alternative, professional misconduct bringing discredit to the profession. Key facts are agreed. Mr Vohora did not keep a controlled drugs register for a period of four years and has not, over some ten years, documented standard operating procedures. The Tribunal considered that this was both misconduct within the scope of his practice and misconduct bringing discredit to the profession. Mr Vohora appeals on the basis that standard operating procedures do not fall within the scope of his practice. There is no evidence of any harm to any patient and he has always acted with due care in the dispensing of medicines. He also says that because

he was charged in the alternative, the Tribunal erred by mixing and matching the types of misconduct when it arrived at its penalty, namely cancellation of his registration.

[99] I also respectfully adopt the 5 points identified by Keane J in A v Professional Conduct Committee: 50
[81] First, the primary purpose of cancelling or suspending registration is to protect the public, but that `inevitably imports some punitive element'. Secondly, to cancel is more punitive than to suspend and the choice between the two turns on what is proportionate. Thirdly, to suspend implies the conclusion that cancellation would have been disproportionate. Fourthly, suspension is most apt where there is

`some condition affecting the practitioner's fitness to practise which may or may not be amenable to cure'. Fifthly, and perhaps only implicitly, suspension ought not to be imposed simply to punish.

Result
[103] I have found that: (a) The Tribunal erred procedurally by combining findings under s 100(1)(a) and (b) for the purpose of discipline; and (b) The cancellation was disproportionate; but (c) Serious sanction is warranted.
[104] In the interim however I prefer to defer my decision to quash the cancellation pending final determination of the appropriate penalty. The current interim orders shall remain in place. [105] I now invite submissions from counsel as to penalty within 10 working days from the respondent, with ten working days for reply by the appellant. [106] I also reserve my position on whether, in the circumstances, the question of the term and conditions and period of suspension (if any) should be a matter for the Tribunal. Submissions should address that potential course as well. [107] Costs are reserved pending final determination.
