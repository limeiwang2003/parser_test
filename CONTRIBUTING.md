**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any original modifications or additions to an existing work of authorship, Submitted by You to Us, in which You own the Copyright.

**"Submit"** means any act by which a Contribution is transferred to Us by You by means of tangible or intangible media, including but not limited to electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Us, but excluding any transfer that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

## Copyright license to Us
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us a worldwide, royalty-free, exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable (except as stated below) license, with the right to transfer an unlimited number of non-exclusive licenses or to grant sublicenses to third parties, under the Copyright covering the Contribution to use the Contribution by all means, including, but not limited to:

This Agreement shall come into effect upon you submitting a Contribution.

This Agreement shall apply for the term of the copyright. However, You shall have the right to terminate the Agreement if We do not fulfill the obligations as set forth in this Agreement. Such termination must be made to Us in writing.

In the event of a termination of this Agreement, those clauses which by their nature are intended to survive termination shall survive such termination and shall remain in full force thereafter. For the avoidance of doubt, Free and Open Source Software (sub)licenses that have already been granted for Contributions at the date of the termination shall remain in full force after the termination of this Agreement.
